### Migration Success (January 29, 2025)

- Initial pdf2json implementation:

  - Text decoding for special characters
  - Maintained consistent chunking interface
  - Tests passing with new implementation
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Review
  - Code structure needs refinement
  - Type safety improvements needed
  - Error handling could be enhanced
  - Performance implications unknown

### Technical Decision (January 29, 2025)

- Issue: pdf-parse throwing "bad XRef entry" errors even on simple PDFs
- Options Considered:
  1. Switch to pdf2json (more complex but battle-tested)
  2. Try patching pdf-parse with documented fix
  3. Revert to PDF.js
- Decision: Try Option 2 first (time-boxed to 10 mins), fallback to pdf2json if unsuccessful
- Rationale:
  - Simple documented fix available
  - Maintains current implementation if successful
  - Clear fallback plan with pdf2json
  - Pragmatic approach for non-core functionality

### Implementation Update (January 29, 2025)

- Attempted pdf-parse patch:
  - Applied isDebugMode fix from Stack Overflow
  - Still encountering XRef errors on simple PDFs
  - Additional "Invalid number" errors appeared
- Next Steps:
  - Removed pdf-parse and patch-package dependencies
  - Proceeding with pdf2json implementation
  - Will maintain same interface for minimal impact on existing code

### Today's Accomplishments (January 28, 2025)

1. Implemented complete PDF processing pipeline:
   - Text extraction with PDF.js
   - Chunking with metadata (page numbers, positions)
   - Storage in Convex
   - Embedding generation with Together.ai

2. Technical Decisions & Learnings:
   - PDF.js version locked to 3.4.120 for stability
   - Together.ai model: m2-bert-80M-8k-retrieval
   - Vector size: 768 dimensions
   - Average vector magnitude: ~4.1
   - Optimal similarity threshold: 4.0
