# Daily Development Log

## January 29, 2025 

### üîÑ Testing Infrastructure Decision (Night)
Decided to switch to Vitest + `convex-test` for backend testing and Playwright for E2E.
- Rationale: Official Convex support, better ESM handling
- Impact: Removing Jest, simpler testing architecture
- Key benefit: Single test runner for backend, E2E for frontend
üìù Full analysis in [testing-strategy.md](./testing-strategy.md)

Quick todos:
- [x] Remove Jest config and dependencies
- [x] Set up Vitest with edge-runtime
- [x] Port one test file as proof of concept
- [x] Set up CI with coverage reporting
- [ ] Fix skipped embeddings test
- [ ] Set up basic Playwright config - üîÑ later

### üéØ Vector Search MVP (Night)
Successfully implemented basic vector search functionality.
- Working: Basic similarity search, document chunking
- Performance: Good enough for MVP
- Issues: Some timeout concerns with large docs

Next steps:
- [ ] Add latency monitoring
- [ ] Implement basic caching
- [ ] Set up error tracking
üìù Full roadmap in [vector-search-plan.md](./vector-search-plan.md)

### üîß Document Processing Improvements (Evening)
Major stability improvements to the pipeline:
- Fixed: Batch processing, cascade deletes, error handling
- Added: Proper TypeScript types, better error boundaries
- Changed: Moved to Convex actions for long tasks

Critical todos:
- [ ] Test with larger documents
- [ ] Add progress UI feedback
- [ ] Document the new processing flow

Known issues:
- PDF.js version sensitivity (locked to 3.4.120)
- Together AI timeouts on large batches
- Missing progress indicators in UI

### üéâ PDF.js Resolution (Evening)
Successfully resolved PDF.js fragility:
- Decided against pdf-parse migration
- Kept PDF.js but improved implementation
- Strategy from pdf-js.md remains valid
- Technical debt reduced significantly

### üéØ Next Session Priority Tasks

1. **Complete Embeddings Pipeline**
   - [x] Fix batch processing in `generateEmbeddings`

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Test with various PDF sizes
   - [ ] Validate embedding quality
   - [ ] Add proper error logging
   - [ ] Document the complete flow

### üîç Code Review Tasks

1. **Type Safety**
   - [x] Replace `any` types with proper interfaces
   - [x] Add type guards for PDF data structure
   - [ ] Consider zod schema for validation
   - [x] Document type structure

2. **Error Handling**

   - [ ] Add error case coverage
   - [x] Test with real-world samples
   - [ ] Add performance tests

### üîÑ Migration Status
- Initial pdf2json implementation complete
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Review
  - Code structure needs refinement
  - Type safety improvements needed
  - Error handling could be enhanced
  - Performance implications unknown

### ü§î Technical Decisions
- Issue: pdf-parse throwing "bad XRef entry" errors
- Options Considered:
  1. Switch to pdf2json
  2. Try patching pdf-parse
  3. Revert to PDF.js
- Decision: Option 2 first, fallback to pdf2json
- Rationale: Simple fix available, clear fallback plan

### üîß Implementation Updates
- Attempted pdf-parse patch:
  - Applied isDebugMode fix
  - Still encountering errors
  - Moving to pdf2json
- Next Steps:
  - Removed pdf-parse dependencies
  - Maintaining same interface

### ‚úÖ Today's Accomplishments

1. **PDF Processing Pipeline**
   - Text extraction with PDF.js
   - Chunking with metadata
   - Storage in Convex
   - Embedding generation with Together.ai

2. **Technical Decisions**
   - PDF.js version: 3.4.120
   - Together.ai model: m2-bert-80M-8k-retrieval
   - Vector size: 768 dimensions
   - Optimal similarity threshold: 4.0

3. **Known Fragilities**
   - PDF.js version sensitivity
   - Together.ai API key management
   - Processing timeouts
