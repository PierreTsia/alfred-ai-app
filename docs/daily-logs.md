### Vector Search Implementation
- Discovered Convex has built-in vector search capabilities ðŸŽ‰
- Created detailed implementation plan: [Vector Search Plan](vector-search.md)
- Key architectural decision: will use Convex's two-step approach (Action + Query) for vector search
- Next: implement schema changes and core search functionality

### Internal Mutations
- Better code organization
- Improved error boundaries and recovery
- Centralized PDF.js version management in config file
  - Version lock maintained at 3.4.120 for stability
  - All version references moved to central config
  - Single source of truth for worker URL
  - Easier future version updates
