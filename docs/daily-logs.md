### Convex Testing Setup Attempt Failed

**Time Spent**: ~2 hours

**What We Did**:
- Attempted to set up Convex testing infrastructure
- Tried multiple approaches to resolve `_generated` directory issues
- Experimented with different environment configurations

**Issues Encountered**:
1. Persistent `_generated` directory recognition issue
2. `convex dev` failing with `setRawMode EIO` error
3. Various configuration attempts didn't resolve the core issue

**Next Steps**:
1. File an issue with Convex team
2. Consider temporary alternatives:
   - Mock Convex functions directly
   - Focus on E2E tests first
   - Use integration tests without `convex-test`

### üêõ Fixed Build-Breaking Bug (Evening)
- Fixed skipped embeddings test that was breaking Vercel build
- Root cause: Missing export in `together-ai-embeddings.test.ts`
- Solution: Extracted test logic into exported function while preserving test case
- Impact: Vercel builds now pass successfully

## January 29, 2025 

### üîÑ Testing Infrastructure Decision (Night)
Decided to switch to Vitest + `convex-test` for backend testing and Playwright for E2E.
- Rationale: Official Convex support, better ESM handling
- Impact: Removing Jest, simpler testing architecture
- Key benefit: Single test runner for backend, E2E for frontend
üìù Full analysis in [testing-strategy.md](./testing-strategy.md)

**Quick todos**:
- [x] Remove Jest config and dependencies
- [x] Set up Vitest with edge-runtime
- [x] Port PDF processor tests
- [x] Set up CI with coverage reporting
- [x] Fix skipped embeddings test - makes vercel build fail priority !
```
./app/test-embeddings/page.tsx
Attempted import error: 'testEmbeddings' is not exported from '@/lib/api/together-ai-embeddings.test' (imported as 'testEmbeddings').
```
- [-] Add basic Convex test (files.list) as proof of concept
- [ ] üîú Set up Playwright - POSTPONED

**Next PR will focus on**:
- Advanced Convex testing (auth, vector search)
- Coverage improvements
- E2E setup with Playwright

### üéØ Vector Search MVP (Night)
Successfully implemented basic vector search functionality.
- Working: Basic similarity search, document chunking
- Performance: Good enough for MVP
- Issues: Some timeout concerns with large docs

**Next steps**:
- [ ] Add latency monitoring
- [ ] Implement basic caching
- [ ] Set up error tracking
üìù Full roadmap in [vector-search-plan.md](./vector-search-plan.md)

### üîß Document Processing Improvements (Evening)
Major stability improvements to the pipeline:
- Fixed: Batch processing, cascade deletes, error handling
- Added: Proper TypeScript types, better error boundaries
- Changed: Moved to Convex actions for long tasks

**Critical todos**:
- [ ] Test with larger documents
- [ ] Add progress UI feedback
- [ ] Document the new processing flow

**Known issues**:
- PDF.js version sensitivity (locked to 3.4.120)
- Together AI timeouts on large batches
- Missing progress indicators in UI

### üéâ PDF.js Resolution (Evening)
Successfully resolved PDF.js fragility:
- Decided against pdf-parse migration
- Kept PDF.js but improved implementation
- Strategy from pdf-js.md remains valid
- Technical debt reduced significantly

### üéØ Next Session Priority Tasks

1. **Complete Embeddings Pipeline**
   - [x] Fix batch processing in `generateEmbeddings`
   - [ ] Add proper error handling and retries

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Test with various PDF sizes
   - [ ] Validate embedding quality
   - [ ] Add proper error logging
   - [ ] Document the complete flow

### üîç Code Review Tasks

1. **Type Safety**
   - [x] Replace `any` types with proper interfaces
   - [x] Add type guards for PDF data structure
   - [ ] Consider zod schema for validation
   - [x] Document type structure

2. **Error Handling**
   - [x] Add specific error types
   - [x] Improve error messages
   - [x] Consider retry mechanism
   - [ ] Add logging strategy

3. **Performance & Memory**
   - [x] Evaluate memory usage for large PDFs
   - [x] Consider streaming for large files
   - [ ] Add performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Compare with previous implementation

4. **Code Structure**
   - [x] Extract PDF parsing logic
   - [x] Add configuration options
   - [ ] Consider builder pattern

   - [ ] Add error case coverage
   - [x] Test with real-world samples
   - [ ] Add performance tests

### üîÑ Migration Status
- Initial pdf2json implementation complete
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Review
  - Code structure needs refinement
  - Type safety improvements needed
  - Error handling could be enhanced
  - Performance implications unknown

### ü§î Technical Decisions
- Issue: pdf-parse throwing "bad XRef entry" errors
- Options Considered:
  1. Switch to pdf2json
  2. Try patching pdf-parse
  3. Revert to PDF.js
- Decision: Option 2 first, fallback to pdf2json
- Rationale: Simple fix available, clear fallback plan

### üîß Implementation Updates
- Attempted pdf-parse patch:
  - Applied isDebugMode fix
  - Still encountering errors
  - Moving to pdf2json
- Next Steps:
  - Removed pdf-parse dependencies
  - Maintaining same interface
