# RAG Pipeline Status

## Current Status (January 29, 2025)

### âœ… COMPLETED

1. Document Ingestion
   - PDF upload & storage in Convex
   - PDF text extraction with PDF.js (v3.4.120)
   - Proper chunking with metadata (page numbers, positions)
   - Cascade delete implementation

2. Embedding Generation
   - Together AI integration (m2-bert-80M-8k-retrieval)
   - Batch processing of all chunks
   - Proper async handling with Convex actions
   - Status tracking (processing â†’ processed)

3. Data Management
   - Clean cascade deletes (files â†’ chunks â†’ embeddings)
   - Proper TypeScript types throughout
   - Error boundaries and recovery
   - Storage cleanup

### ðŸš§ MISSING PIECES

1. Retrieval
   - No similarity search endpoint yet
   - Need vector search implementation
   - No caching strategy for frequent searches

2. Augmentation
   - No prompt engineering yet
   - No context injection mechanism
   - No answer generation setup

3. Quality & Resilience
   - No retry mechanism for failed chunks
   - No embedding quality monitoring
   - No performance benchmarks
   - Limited error handling in Together AI calls

## Known Issues

### ðŸ”¨ Technical Debt

1. Testing (Critical) ðŸš¨
   - No integration tests for the RAG pipeline
   - No E2E tests for critical user flows
   - No error case coverage
   - Missing tests for edge cases (large PDFs, special characters)
   - No monitoring for embedding quality

2. PDF.js Coupling
   - Currently used for both viewing and parsing
   - Version lock affects both features
   - Need to separate concerns

3. Error Handling
   - Basic error states in UI
   - No progress tracking
   - Limited retry mechanisms

4. Performance
   - No caching implementation
   - Basic chunking strategy
   - No optimization for large documents

## Next Priority

1. Vector Search Implementation
   - Design similarity search endpoint
   - Implement chunk retrieval logic
   - Add caching layer
   - Set up quality monitoring

## Reference Metrics

- Vector size: 768 dimensions
- Average vector magnitude: ~4.1
- Optimal similarity threshold: 4.0
- Chunk size: 1000 tokens
- Chunk overlap: 200 tokens
