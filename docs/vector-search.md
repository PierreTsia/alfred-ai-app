# Vector Search Implementation

## Current Status âœ…

The vector search functionality is now fully implemented with a clean architecture:

### Public API
- `storeDocumentChunks`: Handles PDF processing and automatically triggers vector embedding
- `search`: Provides semantic search across all documents or within a specific document
- `getDocument`: Retrieves document metadata

### Internal Processing
- Automatic vector embedding generation using Together AI
- Efficient document chunking and processing pipeline
- Context-aware search results with surrounding text

## Architecture

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Document Upload & Chunking**
   - PDF text extraction with chunk metadata (page, position)
   - Automatic storage of chunks in Convex DB
   - Asynchronous trigger of vector processing

2. **Vector Generation**
   - Together AI's m2-bert-80M-8k-retrieval model for embeddings
   - Automatic processing of new chunks
   - Status tracking throughout the process

3. **Search Implementation**
   - Vector similarity search with user-based filtering
   - Optional document-specific search scope
   - Context retrieval from surrounding chunks

### Security
- All sensitive operations (embedding generation, vector search) are internal
- User-based filtering on all queries
- Document ownership validation

## Performance
- Asynchronous processing to keep UI responsive
- Efficient caching of document metadata
- Optimized vector search with proper indexing

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Add progress tracking for vector processing
2. [ ] Implement batch processing for large documents
3. [ ] Add error recovery for failed embeddings
4. [ ] Consider caching frequently searched vectors

## MVP Steps ðŸŽ¯

1. Schema Setup âœ…
   - [x] Add vector index to documentChunks table
   - [x] Test schema migration on dev environment
   - [x] Verify existing embeddings are compatible

2. Core Search Action (convex/documents.ts) âœ…
   - [x] Create `searchDocuments` action
   - [x] Implement query embedding generation
   - [x] Add vectorSearch with basic params
   - [x] Test with simple queries

3. Document Fetching (convex/documents.ts) âœ…
   - [x] Create `getSearchResults` query
   - [x] Implement document hydration
   - [x] Add surrounding context fetching
   - [x] Test end-to-end flow

4. Basic UI Integration âœ…
   - [x] Add search input component
   - [x] Create results display
   - [x] Show loading states
   - [x] Handle basic error cases

5. Testing & Validation âœ…
   - [x] Test with various query types
   - [x] Verify embedding quality
   - [x] Check performance metrics
   - [x] Document usage patterns

### 4. Caching Strategy (Future)
- [ ] Cache vector search results (from Action)
- [ ] Make document data (from Query) reactive
- [ ] Cache common searches
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation on document updates

## Performance Considerations (Future)
- [ ] Monitor vector search latency
- [ ] Track cache hit rates
- [ ] Consider batch size optimization
- [ ] Watch memory usage with large result sets

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add filter fields to vector index
- [ ] Implement semantic caching
- [ ] Add score thresholding
- [ ] Consider chunking strategy optimization

# Current Status
- Using Together AI's m2-bert-80M-8k-retrieval model for embeddings (768 dimensions)
- Embeddings stored in `documentChunks` table with vector index
- Basic infrastructure for embedding generation in place
- Successfully tested with real queries and validated results

## Test Results ðŸŽ¯
Query: "Tell me about AI and machine learning"
Results:
1. "Vector embeddings help find semantic similarities" (score: 0.52)
2. "Neural networks can learn complex patterns in data" (score: 0.31)
3. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" (score: 0.14)

Results show strong semantic understanding and proper relevance ranking.

## Required Architecture Changes

### 1. Convex Vector Search Specifics âœ…
- Vector search operations are **only available in Actions**
- Implemented two-step approach:
  1. Action: Perform vector search & get IDs
  2. Query: Fetch actual documents

### 2. Schema Updates âœ…
```typescript
documentChunks: defineTable({
  // ... existing fields ...
}).vectorIndex("by_embedding", {
  vectorField: "embedding",
  dimensions: 768,
  filterFields: ["userId"] // Added for security
})
```

### 3. Implementation Flow âœ…
```
User Query -> Action (vector search) -> Query (fetch docs) -> UI
```

#### Action Layer âœ…
- Generate embedding for user query
- Use `ctx.vectorSearch()` to find similar chunks
- Return IDs and similarity scores

#### Query Layer âœ…
- Take IDs from action result
- Fetch full documents
- Include surrounding context for better UX

### 4. Caching Strategy
- [ ] Cache vector search results (from Action)
- [ ] Make document data (from Query) reactive
- [ ] Cache common searches
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation on document updates

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Monitor vector search latency
- [ ] Track cache hit rates
- [ ] Consider batch size optimization
- [ ] Watch memory usage with large result sets

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add filter fields to vector index
- [ ] Implement semantic caching
- [ ] Add score thresholding
- [ ] Consider chunking strategy optimization
