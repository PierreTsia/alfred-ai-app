## Today's Accomplishments (January 28, 2025)

1. Implemented complete PDF processing pipeline:
   - Text extraction with PDF.js
   - Chunking with metadata (page numbers, positions)
   - Storage in Convex
   - Embedding generation with Together.ai
   
2. Technical Decisions & Learnings:
   - PDF.js version locked to 3.4.120 for stability
   - Together.ai model: m2-bert-80M-8k-retrieval
   - Vector size: 768 dimensions
   - Average vector magnitude: ~4.1
   - Optimal similarity threshold: 4.0
   - Convex actions for long-running tasks

3. Known Fragilities:
   - PDF.js version sensitivity
   - Together.ai API key management between environments
   - Processing timeouts for large PDFs

## Next Steps

### Phase 3.2: RAG Implementation
1. [ ] Process remaining chunks in batches
2. [ ] Add progress tracking for embedding generation
3. [ ] Implement similarity search endpoint
4. [ ] Create search UI component
5. [ ] Add error recovery for failed embeddings

### Technical Debt
- [ ] improve auth flow: migrate from explicit userId passing to Clerk-Convex integrated auth
      - Replace manual userId passing with ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()
      - Test integration in non-critical feature first
      - Update all affected mutations and queries - [ ] Make PDF.js version management more robust
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for Together.ai API calls
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for timeouts
- [ ] Add monitoring for embedding quality
- [ ] Consider chunking strategy optimization

### Future Optimizations
1. [ ] Batch processing for large PDFs
2. [ ] Caching strategy for frequent searches
3. [ ] Parallel processing of chunks
4. [ ] Evaluate alternative embedding models
5. [ ] Add support for more document types

## Technical Debt & Improvements

- Implement cascading deletes: When a document is deleted, ensure all related chunks and embeddings are also deleted from their respective tables 

### Code Review Tasks (January 29, 2025)

1. Review Core Processing:
   - [ ] Chunk processing strategy in documents.ts
   - [ ] Error boundaries in PDFPreview.tsx
   - [ ] Vector search indexing strategy
   - [ ] Memory usage optimization for large PDFs

2. Error Handling & Resilience:
   - [ ] Implement local worker file fallback
   - [ ] Add error classification system
   - [ ] Review error recovery strategies
   - [ ] Add system-wide error boundaries

3. Monitoring & Performance:
   - [ ] Define monitoring strategy
   - [ ] Add performance tracking
   - [ ] Implement caching strategy
   - [ ] Add observability metrics

4. Testing Strategy:
   - [ ] Unit tests for core functions
   - [ ] Integration tests for PDF processing
   - [ ] E2E tests for critical paths
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks
